This repository contains simulations of KKL observers with nonlinear contracting dynamics as presented in
*On the existence of KKL observers with nonlinear contracting dynamics*, V. Pachy, V. Andrieu, P. Bernard, L. Brivadis, L. Praly, MICNON 2024.

In the folder "Duffing Oscillator", a simulation compares the performance of KKL observers with slow and fast *linear* dynamics to those of a single KKL observer with *nonlinear* dynamics behaving like:

- the fast linear one when the error is large, i.e., shows fast transient behavior,

- the slow linear one when the error is small, i.e, shows good behavior with noise in steady state.
